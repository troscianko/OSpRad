# OSpRad
An open-source, low-cost, high-sensitivity spectroradiometer

Project by Jolyon Troscianko 2022

This project allows users to build their own low-cost, high-sensitivity spectroradiometer for measuring radiance/irradiance based on the Hamamatsu C12880MA chip.

Testing shows that the system can measure spectral radiance down to around 0.001 cd/sqm, and irradiance down to around 0.005 lx.
