# OSpRad
An open-source, low-cost, high-sensitivity spectroradiometer

Developed by Jolyon Troscianko 2022

Reseased under GPL-3.0 license

This project allows users to build their own low-cost, high-sensitivity spectroradiometer for measuring radiance/irradiance based on the Hamamatsu C12880MA chip.

Testing shows that the system can measure spectral radiance down to around 0.001 cd/sqm, and irradiance down to around 0.005 lx.

Included in this project are the 3D STL files for creating your own housing, code for uploading to an arduino nano microcontroller, and a Python app for interfacing with the OSpRad spectroradiometer via desktop computer or Android smartphone (via Pydroid 3).
